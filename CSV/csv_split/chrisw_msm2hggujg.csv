Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo."

Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me ""Apache"" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege.

"Chris W","Chris W","Nov 3, 2017, 11:13 PM","Here's the thing. You said a ""a PC game is a sport."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a a mod of /r/pcmasterrace who studies PC games, I am telling you, specifically, in PC gaming, no one calls video games sports. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""Video games"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of MOBAS, which includes things from DOTA to LoL to SMITE. So your reasoning for calling a PC game a sport is because random people ""call the MOBAS Sports?"" Let's get counter-strike and starcraft in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A MOBA is a MOBA and a member of the Video game family. But that's not what you said. You said a PC game is a Sport, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the video game family sports, which means you'd call Visual novels, RPG's, and other games sports, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

"Chris W","Chris W","Oct 17, 2018, 9:29 PM","If I ever see a bong I will assume that it is not ornamental until I know otherwise. Lots of friends have smoked weed although I think most didn't seem to have bongs. I wouldn't own one (ornamental or otherwise) as it'd be a bit of a waste of money for me... ... Overall, I dunno, I don't really have strong feelings about them"
"Chris W","Hamish Watson","Oct 17, 2018, 9:38 PM","I ask because I want an ornamental bong for my birthday and mum's wandering if she should"
"Chris W","Chris W","Oct 17, 2018, 9:39 PM","Why not an ornamental buttplug?"

"Chris W","Hamish Watson","Oct 17, 2018, 9:40 PM","You worded that perfectly  üòÇ"
"Chris W","Chris W","Oct 17, 2018, 9:42 PM","I think a bong would be pretty gay but I don't see harm in it either. If you were determined to smoke weed with a bong Ave you didn't have this gift you would just make one out of aluminium or something so I don't think it would make you into some kind of druggy"
"Chris W","Chris W","Oct 17, 2018, 9:43 PM","In fact if you had one and you wanted to smoke weed with a bong you'd be better to not use it anyway in case police found it one day. You know, cause if you used it, it'd become paraphernalia. You already thought of this, I'm kind of spitballing here"
